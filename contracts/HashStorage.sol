/* Features:
Functions to store and retrieve hashes.
Mapping of meter identifiers to their respective data hashes.
Role-based access control for adding hashes.
Reasoning: The contract should be minimalistic yet functional, providing essential features without overcomplicating the logic. 
Mapping meter IDs to hashes ensures efficient data retrieval. 
Role-based access control enhances security by restricting write operations to authorized entities. 
Details:
The contract should include functions to store hashes and retrieve them based on meter identifiers.
Implement access control to ensure only authorized users or systems can submit or query hashes.
Reasoning: A contract focused on hash management ensures the integrity and traceability of meter data
without storing actual consumption data on-chain, aligning with privacy and scalability concerns.*/
